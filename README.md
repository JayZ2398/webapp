## Development

This tutorial will get you running the web app from inside a container. Running code from inside a container, rather than just from your computer, will ensure that if the code works on your computer, it will work anywhere (as long as it's run inside the same container). When it comes to developing, you'll still be writing code inside some place on your computer, so nothing else will change.
